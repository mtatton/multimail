The file bluewave.h is under a different license:

        The Blue  Wave Offline  Mail System  File  Structures  (hereafter
        known as "structures" or "the structures") were created by George
        Hatchew, and  are the  copyrighted property of George Hatchew and
        Cutting Edge  Computing.  Permission is granted for third parties
        to use  these structures  in  their  own  programs,  without  any
        royalties or  licenses required.  Cutting Edge Computing reserves
        the right  to make  any changes to these structures, at any time.
        As such, third parties are requested not to make any unauthorized
        changes to  these structures,  as Cutting  Edge Computing  is not
        bound to  follow these  changes.   Any proposed changes should be
        brought to  the attention  of Cutting  Edge Computing, where they
        may be included in future revisions of the structures.

        Authors that use these structures are allowed to claim that their
        programs are  "Blue Wave compatible", provided that such programs
        can process  mail and  reply packets  that can be handled without
        problems or  difficulties by The Blue Wave Offline Mail Doors and
        Readers from Cutting Edge Computing.  (Think of it as the "litmus
        test" for Blue Wave compatibility.)

        Finally, "Blue  Wave" is  a  trademarked  term  of  Cutting  Edge
        Computing, and  cannot be  used by authors in the titles of their
        applications.   This does  not, however,  restrict the ability to
        describe the application as a "Blue Wave compatible" offline mail
        application (i.e.  "FooBar: The Blue Wave-Compatible Offline Mail
        Door for Widget BBS").

The GPL, below, is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, but the
instance of code that it refers to (the MultiMail packet reader) is
copyrighted by me and the others who wrote it. - William McBrine
